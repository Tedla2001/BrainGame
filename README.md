## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

      Website: https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
  
      I do not have much experience with Javascript so that was a major challenge for me while working on the interactive and the optional features. I tried to overcome this challenge by reviewing the information in the links that were provided in the walkthrough and searching the internetfor potential solutions to the problems I was facing. I found the website I linked in the previous question very helpful. Another challenge I encountered was positioning and designing elements in the webpage. To improve the overall design of my webpage I asked some of my friends for their opinions on how I could make it more visually appealing. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
  
      As I mentioned in the previous question, I am not very familar with Javascript so I would like to learn more about Javascript. I am excited to see what kind of other features could be built using it. Some questions I have about web development are:
            <br>- What are some useful tools web developers use to design their websites? <br>
            - What kind of features attract more users?<br>
            - How do you pick good color schemes to improve the overall look of your website?<br>
  

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
  
      If I had a few more hours, I would probably add a couple more features. One would be a menu to allow ther user to choose the difficulty of the game. The harder the difficulty the faster the pattern and the more blocks there would be displayed. Another feature I would have liked to add would be a score system and a leader board because I think competition would make the game more entertaining for the user.
